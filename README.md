# Creating Eletronic Music
This is a creative exercise by using garage band to create a music in chinese as gift to a group of child from a volunteer work

Brief Description of the motivation of this project: 

  We started this project on April 25, 2021. During this pandemic, having no experience and neither do you, it was certainly not easy to get here!
  There were many learnings, reflections and moments of joy.
  As the end of this blessed year, we have prepared a Christmas video for a good memory both for you and for us.
